	      <p>The Spy's Guide To American History</p>
	    </header>
	    <p>His first book, A Spy’s Guide to Santa Fe and Albuquerque, recounts the surprising place that New Mexico has in modern espionage. Few Americans think of New Mexico as a hotbed of  spy-vs-spy intrigue but in fact, the single greatest intelligence meeting in KGB history, its single  greatest counterintelligence coup, and the planning of its most infamous assassination all took place within one mile of Bishop Lamy’s statue in front of Saint Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe. Held’s book tells these and other stories and includes guided walking tours of important spy sites in Santa Fe and Albuquerque.

</p>
	    <p>Held’s second book is A Spy’s Guide to the Kennedy Assassination (2013). The 1963  assassination of President Kennedy was a genuine tragedy in the Greek definition of that word, “a serious play having a disastrous ending brought about by the central characters impelled by  fate.” Held’s book brings that tragedy to life including photos of where central characters lived  and important events occurred as well as guided walking tours of Georgetown, New Orleans  and, of course, Dallas.</p>
